## Note

I did publish this to the App Store Connect so that this could be tested on a
real iOS device using Test Flight, but it is still awaiting approval from Apple.
If it gets approved I will add the Test Flight link here.

## Next Steps

If I had a bit more time I would have:

- Added tests i.e Jest and RTL
- Combining Tailwind with twin.macro and Styled Components to make more reusable
  components
- Image placeholder for films without a poster image
- Loading spinners for loading states
- Testing on Android. I was seeing a network error causing a crash on the
  Android Simulator that prevented me from testing it fully there. Could just be
  a Simulator thing and works fine on a real device but needs some debugging
